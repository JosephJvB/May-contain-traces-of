Just some idea I had sitting in the bath and looking at the bottle of body-wash I have. Ingredient lists are something we are all pretty familiar with. For me I had lots of allergies as a kid so I was browsing them often.

Cool so enough sharing. Im gonna make something that reads package.json's and then creates a list of "ingredients" aka dependencies & dev-deps.

## usage:
**Basic:** Run against a directory with a package.json at top level, output will be the ingredients of the local package.json.

**More exciting:** run with 1st arg of any npm package name. output will be the ingredients of that packages package.json file.

### TODO
- publish!
