List-Ingredients

Just some idea I had sitting in the bath and looking at the bottle of body-wash I have. Ingredient lists are something we are all pretty familiar with. For me I had lots of allergies as a kid so I was browsing them often.

Cool so enough sharing. Im gonna make something that reads package.json's and then creates a list of "ingredients" aka dependencies & dev-deps.

### Basic
- read package and print it to console

### Up-Nexts
- Use an API? I wonder if bundlephobia has something I can use
- Make an API? Give a package name/link then go to `github.com/package/package.json` parse contents and print them.
- Maybe use bundlephobia to find github page, then do some basic scrape. (if there even IS one haha)
